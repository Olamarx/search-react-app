# Search Image Project

In this project, I created an app with React framework. It fetches images from the API and renders on the UI in an ordered form. I used React.createRef() to get the clientHieght of each image and used it to give it a nice grid-row-end.

## Built With

- React
- Semantic UI
- Unsplash API
- CSS
